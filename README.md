# CRUD Blog Application

A simple blog application with CRUD operations created using React and Express as part of job training. It can be run on your local machine, where you can create, read, update, and delete posts on the blog.

## Clone the Repository

To get a copy of the repository on your local machine, open your terminal and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/akivaab/training-node-express.git
```

Or, you can download the ZIP file from the GitHub page.

## Running the Project

#### Add .env Files

Once youâ€™ve cloned or downloaded the repository, you must add a .env file in both the server and client directories. There are .env.example files in both directories explaining what environment variables must be added.

- [server/.env example](server/.env.example)
- [client/.env example](client/.env.example)

#### Run Server and Client

Once the .env files are added, open two instances of the terminal and navigate to the root directory of the repository in both.

Enter the following commands in the first terminal:

```
cd server
npm install
npm run start
```

Then enter the following commands in the second terminal:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Click on the provided link to open the project on a port of your local machine.
